    <h4> Chocolatey, Chewy, Fudgy texture</h4>
    <p>Easy to prepare, comes together quickly</p> 
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter (1 stick)</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup dark or semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 325 degrees, with a rack positioned in the center. Grease an 8-inch-square baking pan with cooking spray and line the bottom with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine the butter and sugar in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter comes to a simmer. Turn off the heat, then add the chocolate chips and stir until melted. (The mixture will be grainy at this point.) Pour into a large mixing bowl and set aside until just warm to the touch.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs and vanilla to the mixing bowl and whisk vigorously for 1 minute, until pale and glossy. Add the cocoa powder and whisk until incorporated. Add the flour, salt and baking soda and mix with a wooden spoon or spatula until well combined. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and smooth the top.</li>
        <li>Bake brownies until a toothpick comes out with just a few crumbs on it, 30 to 33 minutes. Cool completely in the pan before slicing into squares. Brownies will keep for up to 3 days, well-wrapped at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
